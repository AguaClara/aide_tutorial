# A Meeting About Agile Grading Practices

## Goal Questions to Address
* What is Agile and how is it appropriate for AguaClara?
* Personnel structure... will there be separate graders? Or will there be RAs that cannot take the course and will also grade?
* How will we pick the next group of RA's? How will we mentor them?
* Will we use Sprint Meetings to track team progress?
* How do we grade the graders or can we pay them?

## Order of Events
1. Recap of current leadership structure/grading structure 
2. Ethan walks through the [grading document](https://github.com/AguaClara/aide_tutorial/wiki/Grading), paying special attention to what a Sprint Report looks like.
3. Group brainstorming. Come up with:
    1. List of things still needed to be documented
    2. Any comments/suggestions of what to change
    3. Focus on the idea of sprint meetings and reports (this is the largest change!)
4. Answer the question: will we adopt Agile for the team at large? Or shall we go back to the drawing board?
5. How to move forward? Who needs to do what?
